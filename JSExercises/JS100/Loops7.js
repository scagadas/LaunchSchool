// for (let i = 0; ; i += 1) {
//   console.log("and on");
// }

//the following code keeps looping forever
//why is that
//modify it so that it stops after the first iteration

//it keeps looping becuase there is no condition set for it to terminate


for (let i = 0; ; i += 1) {
  console.log("and on");
  break // terminates the program
}
