// What's my value? (part 8)

// Problem:
// What will the following code log the console? Why?

let a = 1;

function myFunction(a) {
  console.log(a);
}

let b = 2;

myFunction(b);

// the code initializes a variable a with the value 1
// the console will log the number 2
// myfunction is being invoked with the variable b as an argument
// the myfunction logs to the console the value of b, which is 2
